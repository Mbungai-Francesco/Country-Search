## Overview

- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region

- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode *(optional)*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Tailwind
- [Typescript] (https://v2.tailwindcss.com/) - Tailwind Docs
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

This the first time I use an API with react, its the first time I even use react..ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…
So I can say I learnt a lot about react, like the whole code is a lesson

### Continued development

I'll really like to come back and work on my api fetching method, cause for now, if the pages loads before the fetch, the page will not be refreshed.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind docs](https://v2.tailwindcss.com/docs) - The tailwind docs really helped me getting throught it all.
